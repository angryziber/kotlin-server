* json/jackson: TypedHttpClient/JsonHttpClient now have overridable trimToLog property in case you need to process how requests/responses are logged
* jobs: JobRunner.schedule() now takes kotlin.time.Duration values

* json: TSGenerator can now receive additional library types to generate from command-line, e.g. klite.TSID
* i18n: do not trim translations by default (keep all whitespace)
* jdbc: support binding of Int values to data classes (DB usually returns integers as Long)
* jdbc: possibility to use table aliases when getting of columns from ResultSet with joins/using create (Postgres only)
* jdbc: allow whitespace between -- and keywords in changeset sql files
* server: default RequestLogFormatter will not log StatusCodeExceptions anymore
* server: useHashCodeAsETag() introduced to avoid sending of same responses

# 1.5.1
* json: ValueConverter.from() can now have access to the expected KType
* json: TSGenerator to generate TypeScript types for data classes/enums

# 1.5.0

* core: TSID introduced as an alternative to UUID
* json: new lightweight json parser
* i18n: now uses the lightweight klite-json, not jackson
* jackson: package changed to klite.jackson to avoid conflicts with klite-json
* jackson: .parse<T> extension function now passes type parameters to Jackson, not only the main class
* jdbc: fromValues() was renamed to create()
* jdbc: switched db.select() <-> db.query(), taking "where" as a list or varargs, to allow for duplicated columns

The release is **not fully backwards-compatible**, however most old functions are provided as @Deprecated.

This will migrate the most important parts:
`find -name '*.kt' -exec sed -ri 's/klite.json./klite.jackson./; s/mapOfNotNull/notNullValues/; /db\.(query|select)/{N; s/db\.query/db.xxxselect/g; s/db\.select/db.query/g; s/mapOf/listOf/g; s/emptyMap/emptyList/g};' {} \; -exec sed -ri 's/db\.xxxselect/db\.select/; s/(db.update\(.*, )mapOf\((.*?\)), (mapOf\(.*?\))\)/\1\3, \2/; s/(db.delete\(.*, )mapOf\((.*?)\)/\1\2/' {} \;`

**Beware**: if you use the replacement above, then make sure that no deprecated query/select usages are left, i.e. check that all "where" maps are replaced with lists/varargs, which is done automatically only if on the same or next line.

You may also use IDEA migration of deprecations, but it will most likely [break code formatting, etc](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KTIJ-24870).
Also, you may need to add some imports manually.
